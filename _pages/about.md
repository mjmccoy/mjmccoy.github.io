I’m a postdoctoral researcher in Andy Fire’s lab at Stanford, and I’m using genomics to try and understand how our brain got so complex. Our 86 billion neurons are precisely connected by trillions of synapses. If we look at the genes encoding synaptic proteins, they’re all enormous. These genes are particularly large in humans, and my research has found that during evolution, they also become more complex, encoding vast numbers of unique isoforms helping to specify the precise wiring of our nervous system. However, at the same time, large genes are frequently mutated or misregulated in brain diseases and disorders. I hope that by studying gene size evolution and regulation, we might learn how complex brains evolve as well as how to prevent or treat disease that arise from this complexity.
